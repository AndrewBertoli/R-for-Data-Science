## Introduction

Remember how we said that R started off as a functional language? This means that, underneath the hood, R is built on many small functions that can be grouped together in smart ways to do powerful things. It also means that, if you want to do more complicated things in R than run summary statistics and linear models, you'll need to learn how to create and use functions.

In R, functions are first-class citizens. This means that you can do anything to a function that you can do to an object, including using functions to create other functions.

> side note - while you can use loops in R, the community strongly discourages explicit looping in favor of implicit loop functionals like `Filter` and `lapply`
